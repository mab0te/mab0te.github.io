## About me

Hey! I'm Gaetan a cyber security researcher with a passion for offensive security and vulnerabilities in general. Let's be honest, I'm an everything security-related enthusiast but finding, analysing, and exploiting vulnerabilities is what fuels me.

I currently work remotely from the Rouen area in the countryside of France where I live with my family. When not breaking things, I enjoy growing vegetables, fishing, spending time with my kids and all kinds of things.

If you come to cross me, why not share a chess game and a glass of good whisky?
